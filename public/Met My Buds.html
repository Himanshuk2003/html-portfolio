<h1>MET MY BUDDS</h1>
<h3><p>It was the next day when my 12th Board exams were over and we(I,Junaid and Abhinav) decided to do a meet up.
    Firstly we were not sure where to go but then Junaid said that we should go to KFC
    and try some chicken stuffs.It was the worst ever chicken burger I have ever eaten in my life.After that,to change our pellet we went
    to the Samosa Shop and we took one samosa and one kachori.</p></h3>

 These are some of the pictures or rather I should say ,memories of that day.
